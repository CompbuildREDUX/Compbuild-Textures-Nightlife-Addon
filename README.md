# Compbuild Textures Nightlife & Rosegold Addon

Compbuild Textures includes two duo downloadable addons which add CIT variants of blocks.

**Nightlife:** This addon includes black modernist furniture, works best for dark/night environments.

**Rosegold:** The name of the addon says it all, rosegold is an addon focused on color and overall environmental feel.

DISCLAIMER: These addons will NOT be updated to 5.0, 4.0.4.4 will be the only version that will have compatibility and may or may not make an appearance in 5.0.

## How to install

You can place either addon over Compbuild Textures, placing both addons at the same time can also work as well.

**Installing the addon is very similar to installing the main pack, all you need to do is place the addon over the main pack.**

## What is the point of releasing scrapped assets instead of just deleting them?

We've came a long way from being a simple texture pack with a few textures to a full pack with 1000+ models and textures combined together. Some ideas aren't as good as we liked them, so we left them out and kept them in storage for a quite a while until now.
